I'm a Fullstack Web Developer Junior with advanced knowledge in the following technologies and frameworks: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Less, Bootstrap, React, Redux, Node Js, Express, Testing, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, GitHub, Trello, etc. I'm eager to start working as a developer to improve my skills and continue learning new technologies.

I have the experience working in team developing two projects (4 sprints each) with scrum, agile methodologies. The first one was a prototype of a Sport Ecommerce where we use; React, Redux, Bootstrap, Ant design, etc. in the Front End and for the Back End; Node.js with Express Router, Passport Authentication, Mailgun, Sequelize and PostreSQL.

The second project was a Digital Wallet App, called Henry Bank which is a mobile first concept using React Native, Redux, Expo in the Front End and for the Back End we implemented a microservices architecture with Express Gateway, Passport, Sendgrid, Sequelize and PostreSQL.

If you like, you can take a look to the projects and please send me your comments:

Before I took the decision of diving into the digital world and became a programmer, I'd studied Petroleum Engineering and had the experience of working in the Oil Industry for almost 5 years as a Company Man leading the operations, men and logistics of many drilling rigs, ensuring everything were executed according to the plan in a safe and efficient manner.
